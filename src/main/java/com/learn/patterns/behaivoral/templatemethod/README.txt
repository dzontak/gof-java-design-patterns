Template Method

Concepts

* Code Reuse
* Common in libraries/frameworks
* IoC

Example
* java.util.Collection.sort()
* java.util.AbstractList.indexOf();

Design

* Abstract Base Class
* Base calls Child
* Hooks
* Operations
* AbstactBase, ConcreteBase

Pitfalls
* Restrict access
* confusing hierarchy
* difficult program flow

Compare
Temlate Method
* Sampe algorithm with different impl
* class based
* compile time

Strategy
* Algorithm per strategy
* Interface based
* run time


Summary

* Guarantees algorithm adherence
* IoC
* Easier implementation
