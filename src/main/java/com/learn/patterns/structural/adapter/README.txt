Adapter pattern

* Plug adapter
* Convert interface into another
* Legacy
* Translating requests
* Client, Adapter Adaptee

examples
* [] -> Lists (Arrays.asList(int[])
* Streams

Design
* Client centric
* Integrate new with old
* Interface, but not required
* Adaptee can be the implementation

Pitfalls
* Don't complicate
* Multiple adapters
* Don't add functionality


Adapter
* works after code is designed
* legacy
* provide different interface

Bridge
* designed upfront
* abstraction and implementation vary
* build in advance
* both adapt multiple systems


Summary
* Simple solution
* Easy to implement
* Integrate with Legacy
* can provide multiple adapters
