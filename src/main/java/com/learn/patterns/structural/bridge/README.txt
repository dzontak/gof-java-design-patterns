Bridge Pattern

* Decouple Abstraction and Implementation
* encapsulation composition and inheritance
* changes in abstraction won't affect client
* details won't be right at the beginning

Examples

* Drivers
    * Jdbc drivers

Design
* Interfaces and abstract classes
* composition over inheritance
* More than composition
* Abstraction, Implementor RefinedAbstraction and ConcreteImplementor


Pitfalls

* Increases complexity
* Conceptually difficult to plan

Contrast
Bridge
* Designed upfront
* Abstraction and impl.
* Build in advance
* Complex

Adapter
* works after code is designed
* legacy
* Provide a different interface

Summary
* Design for uncertainty
* Can be complex
* provides flexibility
* more than composition
