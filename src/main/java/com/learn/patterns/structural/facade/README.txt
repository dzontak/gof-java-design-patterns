Facade

Concepts
* make an api easier to use
* reduce dependencies on outside code
* simplify interface for client usage
* usually a refactoring pattern

Examples
java.net.URL


Design
* Class that utilizes composition
* Shold not have a need for inheritance
* typically encompasses full lifecycle

Pitfalls
* Typically used to clean up code
* Should think about api design
* flat problem structure
* The "Singleton" of Structural Pattern

Contrast

Facade
* simplifies interface
* works with composites
* provides cleaner api

Adapter
* also a refactoring pattern
* modifies behavior (adds)
* provides a different interface

Summary
* Simplifies client interface
* Easy pattern to implement
